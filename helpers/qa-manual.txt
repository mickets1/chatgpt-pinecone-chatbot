How to calculate the tree view
The Tree report shows a view of ownership structure. It is calculated based on the legal structure with the group parent in the top and the subsidiaries sorted below each parent entity. 
The ownership column shows the direct ownership of the entity (with how many percentage it is owned by the parent entity), the total ownership shows the ownership including all internal shareholders. The ownership weighted shows the weighted ownership by the parent entity while the total ownership weighted shows how much the top parent or the group owns in the entity.
The drop-down in the top left enables you to choose any entity in the group as top parent. This gives you all the summarized and weighted ownerships and votes from the perspective of any selected entity, as an alternative to viewing it from the regular group parent. Use ‘Reload’ to update your settings.
You may change the date in the date field and then click on the ‘Reload’ button to view the legal ownership tree on the date you have chosen. The default view is set to the last day of the current active period. Use ‘Reload’ to update your settings.
To sort out companies in the Tree view, click on the ‘Show filter’ button to open the search fields.
By using the search fields to filter the selection of your choice, you will then be able to view only those entities you have selected in the tree by clicking on the button ‘Show Selected Only’. You can also use the ‘Skip’ up-or-down-buttons to mark the selected entities in the tree. The selected entities will have a checkmark in the box visible in column C. 
To return to viewing all entities click on the same button which now has changed its name to ‘Show All’. To reset your filters and show the entire tree, click on the ‘Reset’ button.
Tips! You can right click on entities in the Tree report to bring up a menu of shortcuts and functions for that entity and its related data.

Can I get a Visio chart for a specific entity?
Yes, but a Microsoft Visio license is required for the software. You can contact your IT department if you need one.

----

Where can I get Visio charts out of Blika?

This can also be accessed from Entity Management: Shareholdings: Tree. 
This option might be available if there is a restriction on the access rights.

----

Create charts in Visio
To create charts in Microsoft Visio you need two things. First, you need to have Visio installed on your computer, as Blika do not provide the Visio license or software. Secondly, you need to install the Visio add-in. You find a link in your Account area in the Blika application, under Extensions, together with detailed instructions on how to install the add-in.
Once you have the Visio add-in and Microsoft Visio installed on your computer, you can start Visio and log in using you Blika credentials in the Blika tab. Then you can start creating charts!

----

Updating Visio Charts
The Visio add-in will provide updates whenever the data in the existing charts are affected by changes in the Blika application. However, these charts will not be updated automatically, instead someone needs to open up the Blika tab in Visio, click on the ‘Browse Charts’ button. 
A new window will open where you can see the charts and in the Updates tab all updates will be listed and to update a chart, mark the chart and click on the ‘Open Chart’ button. The chart will open and a dialog box will appear, stating all updates and changes, click on the ‘Update Visio Drawing’ button to update (if you instead click on ‘Later’ then the chart will remain as it was the last time you saved it and it will not be updated after the latest changes but the option to update will remain). Save the updated chart and the chart, with the updated changes, will now be up to date. 
If the chart is published on the Blika site then it will automatically updated there as well, just refresh the page. The layout of the updated chart can be fixed if needed, before you save as some updates will ruin the original layout of the chart.

----

Visio chart including disposed entities
Always first check the data in Blika and make sure the ownership for the entity is zeroed out as Visio is using the transactions to build the chats. Secondly check the date which is used for the chart and compare it with the date for the zero out transaction. If the transaction date is in February and the chart is for January, the chart will not cover this change.

----

Viewing Visio Charts in the Blika application
To make Visio charts available in the Blika application, under Special Reports and Org Charts, the chart must first be created in the Visio program together with our Visio add-in and made public by check marking the ‘Publish to Web’ button. If the chart is published to the web, then users with access to the chart can view in from the application. 

----

Access rights to view Visio Charts in the Blika application
Super Admins can always view all the charts, both the un-published ones inside Visio and all charts published on the web. 
Users however need the view or edit right for charts (or Corporate Information plus Shareholdings access) for the included companies in Company Permission. For example, a chart over all German entities can only be seen by a user with a Company Permission set including all German entities. If the user only has access to half of the German entities, then the German chart will not be available as half of the entities will be outside the user’s permissions.
The View Charts permission and CI+SH permission gives the same access regarding Charts. The reason to use View Charts instead of CI+SH is if the user is only supposed to View Charts but not the Shareholdings module.

----

Access rights to create and edit Visio Charts 
Super Admins can always create and edit charts for all companies. 
Users however need the edit right for charts for the included companies in Company Permission. For example, a chart over all German entities can only be created or edited by a user with a Company Permission set including all German entities and with edit rights for charts. If the chart includes all companies up to the top parent, then companies not belonging to Germany can be included as they are needed to show the ownership structure.
User cannot edit other users' Charts that does not have "Public Edit" checked.

----

The Chart Settings Layout Errors
Sometimes the layout in the Chart Settings is disturbed, for instance the filter settings can be hidden. In this case, try to first log out of Visio and close the program, then change your display setting to 100 % and then go to Visio and log in again. The layout should now be restored.
